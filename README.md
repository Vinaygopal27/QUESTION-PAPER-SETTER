**INTRODUCTION**
Assessment is a continuous systematic process that inferences about learning and development of students. It is a process of defining, selecting, designing, collecting, analyzing, interpreting and using information  to  increase  students’  learning  and  development.  One  of  the  assessment  methods  is examination or test that aims to measure the students’ knowledge based on the LO. Examinations have been chosen as assessment methods to assess student learning by the end of the course. Moreover, examinations are crucial for the academic teacher and learning process as well as to the school or university’s administration procedures. It can be seen from the school or university’s perspective that examination aims is to gauge their students’ ability and competitiveness. On the other hand, for the students, the examinations give those goals and pushing them to attain that goal in the specific time. As for the teacher or university lecturer, the examinations results provide them the learning outcome curves that allow them for improvement in the future towards better learning process.

**SCOPE:**

     The main scope of the project is to develop A design of suitable automated system for generating question papers and managing related data may prove vital in an Educational Institute. In this project, we have proposed an integrated automated system that stores questions related to a particular course and prints a question paper based on its syllabus and curriculum. We have implemented a role-based hierarchy which restricts access to the users. The system also deploys security mechanisms that prohibit duplication of question papers. There are provisions to enter and edit data suitable to any educational organization with complete freedom for specifying courses, semesters, syllabus and pattern
